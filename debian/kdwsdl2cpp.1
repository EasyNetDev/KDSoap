.SH USAGE
Header file: \fB\,kdwsdl2cpp\/\fR [options] \fB\-o\fR <headerfile> <wsdlfile>
.TP
Impl.  file: \fB\,kdwsdl2cpp\/\fR [options] \fB\-o\fR <cppfile> \fB\-impl\fR <headerfile> <wsdlfile>
.TP
Both files : \fB\,kdwsdl2cpp\/\fR [options] \fB\-both\fR <basefile> <wsdlfile>
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-version\fR
display version
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-service\fR
name of the service to generate
.TP
\fB\-o\fR <file>
output the generated file into <file>
.TP
\fB\-impl\fR <headerfile>
generate the implementation(.cpp) file, and #include <headerfile>
.TP
\fB\-both\fR <basefilename>
generate both the header(.h) and the implementation(.cpp) file
.TP
\fB\-server\fR
generate server\-side base class, instead of client service
.TP
\fB\-exportMacro\fR <macroname>
set the export declaration to use for generated classes
.TP
\fB\-namespace\fR <ns>
put all generated classes into the given C++ namespace
.TP
\fB\-namespaceMapping\fR <mapping>
add the uri=code mapping
if <mapping> begins with '@', read from file instead
one entry per line
(affects the generated class names)
.TP
\fB\-optional\-element\-type\fR <type>
use <type> as the getter return value for optional elements.
<type> can be either raw\-pointer, boost\-optional or std\-optional
.TP
\fB\-keep\-unused\-types\fR
keep the wsdl unused types to the cpp generation step
.TP
\fB\-import\-path\fR <importpath> search for files first in this path before
downloading them. may be specified multiple times.
the file needs to be located at:
<importpath>/<url\-host>/<url\-path>
.TP
\fB\-use\-local\-files\-only\fR
only use local files instead of downloading them
automatically. this can be used to force the correct
use of the import\-path option
.TP
\fB\-help\-on\-missing\fR
When groups or basic types could not be found, display
available types (helps with wrong namespaces)
.TP
\fB\-pkcs12file\fR
Load a certificate from a PKCS12 file. You can use this option
if the WSDL file (or files refering to it) is served from a
location which require certificate based authentication
.TP
\fB\-pkcs12password\fR
