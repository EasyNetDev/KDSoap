# KDSoap for Debian

## Debian DFSG repacked version of the original upstream sources

The current original upstream version of KDSoap contains some files who can not
be included in this Debian package:

* The folder `unittests/` have been excluded because it contains
 several non-free files or files depending on them.

* The PDF manual file have been excluded because its sources are missing.
